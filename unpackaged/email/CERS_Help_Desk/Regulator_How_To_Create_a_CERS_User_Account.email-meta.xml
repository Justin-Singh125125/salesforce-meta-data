    <textOnly>How to Create and Activate a New CERS Regulator User Account:


Open your web browser and navigate to the CERS Central page. (http://cers.calepa.ca.gov)
Select the “Regulator Portal Sign In” link from the top of the CERS Central page.
Select the “Create New Account” button, located below the “New to CERS?” section of the CERS Regulator Sign In page.
After completing the web form, select the “Create My Account” button.
You will then receive an e-mail notification, from CERS, containing an Account Activation Link. Open the link provided in the e-mail message to activate your CERS Business user account.
Once your account has been activated, you will then need to return to the CERS Regulator Sign In page and sign-in to CERS Regulator, using your username and password.
After signing-in to CERS Regulator, select the “Register” button from the Home page.
Select your agency from the corresponding drop-down menu and enter your phone number and/or position title with the agency. (Phone number and position title fields are optional.)
Then, select the “Request Access” button to submit an Access Request to the Lead User(s) for the regulator, in CERS.
Once your Access Request has been approved, you will receive a notification – via an automated e-mail message, from CERS, as well as a notification in CERS Regulator on the Home page. (Under the corresponding “Regulator Notifications” section.) You can then return to the CERS Regulator Sign-In page and sign-in to CERS Regulator – now with all menu bar buttons activated and the CERS Regulator Home page populated with data/information pertaining to your agency.</textOnly>
