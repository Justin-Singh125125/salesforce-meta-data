    <textOnly>“To attain access to your business in CERS, you will first need to create a CERS Business user account of your own. To create a CERS Business user account, please follow the instructions outlined, below.  How to Create and Activate a New CERS Business User Account:  1.	Open your web browser and navigate to the CERS Central page. (http://cers.calepa.ca.gov) 2.	Select the “Business Portal Sign In” link from the top of the CERS Central page. 3.	Select the “Create New Account” button, located below the “New to CERS?” section of the CERS Business Sign In page. 4.	After completing the web form, select the “Create My Account” button. 5.	You will then receive an e-mail notification, from CERS, containing an Account Activation Link. Open the link provided in the e-mail message to activate your CERS Business user account.  Once you have completed the email information, your CERS user account has been activated, you can then return to the CERS Business Sign In page and sign-in to CERS Business, using your username and password. Once you have signed-in, select the “Add Facility” button/link from the Home page. Use the “Add Facility” process to locate your facility by its physical address. Once located, you can then request access to the facility and its associated business organization.  You will then need to contact the regulatory agency that your business’ facility reports to – to request that a member of their agency approve your pending Access Request to the business. Upon approving your Access Request, the approving regulator user will need to select which account permissions you should have to the business organization, in CERS. Therefore, you may want to specify what level of access you will need to have to the business organization, when communicating with the approving regulatory agency staff. (CERS account permission types have been outlined in the image/screenshot, below.)      If your permissions are set to that of a Lead User, you could then remove the previous/inactive business user(s) from the business organization, by following these instructions:  1.	Sign-in to CERS Business and select the “My Business” button, from the right-hand side of the CERS Business menu bar. (Located at the top of each page.) 2.	Select the “People” link, from the sub-menu on the left-hand side of the “My Business” page. 3.	Use the “Select” button, next to a business user’s name/information, to open that user’s “Details” page. 4.	Then, select the “Delete” button and confirm to remove that user’s permissions to the business organization. (Please Note: This will only remove the business user’s access to that particular business organization, in CERS. This will not delete an entire CERS Business user account or affect a business user’s access to other business organizations, in CERS.)   For further assistance or guidance on this matter, please contact the regulatory agency.  If you do not have the contact information for the regulatory agency, you can locate that information by signing-in to CERS Business and selecting the “Tools” link, (located in the upper-right hand corner of each page, in CERS) then select the “CUPA Contact Information/Listing” link from the Tools page, to view a listing of contact information for all agencies.  You may also refer to our public website: http://calepa.ca.gov and open the “Unified Program Regulator Directory” page, here: http://cersapps.calepa.ca.gov/Public/Directory/ to locate the same information.”</textOnly>
